    "#### 1.1 CALAKMUL BIOSPHERE RESERVE\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR) is the largest protected tropical forest in Mexico with ~ 7230 km<sup>2</sup>  host to considerable floral and faunal diversity (Garcia-Gil et al., 1999; Morales and Magana 2001; Pinzon et al., 2021). Protected in 1989, the CBR stands to lose its conservation value as climate change and increasing drought stress push animals, notably groups of white-lipped and collared peccaries (*Tayassu pecari* and *Pecari tajacu*), south into more humid environments (Reyna-Hurtado et al., 2012; O'Farril et al., 2014; Pinzon et al., 2021).\n",

    "<center>CAMPECHE, MEXICO</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Peccary groups, both white-lipped and collared, are particularly well adapted to the spatial density and distribution of waterbodies. Although collared peccaries also have ecological adaptations suited for water scarcity (Reyna-Hurtado et al., 2014), both collared and white-lipped peccaries use waterbodies for drinking and wading or splashing-in to quench thirst as well as avoid ectoparasites (Reyna-Hurtado et al., 2014; 2017). In tropical forests, like the CBR, movements of both peccary species are related to waterbodies (Hernandez 2013; Garcia-Marmolejo et al., 2015). Species best associated with waterbodies are expected to move south, in search of wetter and more humid environments. As peccary are a major source of food for jaguars, and in the dry season for people, this dynamic could lead to poor conservation and human livelihoods outcomes. Understanding where and when intermittent waterbodies are available is a critical step towards simulating the movement of peccary groups in changing environmental conditions. "

    "#### 1.2 WATERBODIES\n",
    "\n",
    "While no permanent waterbodies persist in the CBR, intermittent waterbodies -- known locally as 'sartenejas', 'aguadas', and 'civales' -- become apparent based on precipitation and environmental conditions. These intermittent waterbodies are critical sources of water for both local human and wildlife populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sartenejas are very small, often less than 1 metre in diameter, depressions on limestone which fill with even low amounts of precipitation. Aguadas are 3 - 10 metres in diameter, circular, shallow, and fill with precipitation as rainwater follows topographic gradients. Civales are small, ephemeral, marshy wetlands with shallow bodies of water within them. They are referred to as a type of intermittent lake by local peoples adajacent to the CBR in Guatemala (Ensley et al., 2021). In this report, civales are distinguished from aguadas, as being larger than 10 metres in diameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on context (i.e., socio-ecological or biological conditions) fauna in the forest reserve rely on one, two, or all three of these intermittent waterbodies. Sartenejas, aguadas, and civales each fill according to participation and hydrological conditions (i.e., fed through networks of streams and wetlands). The relative availability of water at these waterbodies is not linear; sartenejas are maintained even when aguadas run dry as small-amounts of sporadic rain is often enough to fill a sarteneja. Within the Southern zone of the CBR, tweleve aguadas were monitored using camera-traps to determine water level, as well as faunal activity from 2014 - 2017. I intend to use this time frame for this exploratory study. The changing spatial distribution of waterbodies in the region are a proxy for understanding worsening drought, climate change, and peccary movement ecology. The aim of this study is to explore remote-sensing and programmatic methods for detection of small intermittent waterbodies in the CBR and available Planet imagery. "

    "For both seasons, three months were composited to create mosaics characterizing the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. The dry season mosaics are composites of all images collected (by the PlanetScope sensor and with specified filters) of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve from December 2016 to February 2017.

    "\n",
    "While both tools yielded similar results, there are notable similarities and differences. All of the above mosaics, for both dry and wet seasons, remain occluded by clouds. This is expected, especially in the wet season, when precipitation is highest and cloud cover remains over the region. As well, both seasons - as defined by three-month periods - do not have full cover by the PlanetScope sensor. The dry season has missing sections in the South-East most part of the CBR. Worse, the wet season has missing images over the region where our tweleve known aguadas and their water availability are monitored. \n",
    "\n",
    "While missing components cannot be addressed without either expanding the time range of each season, or by combining with alternative remote-sensing products, there are three relevent methods for correcting cloudy images. That is, to create cloud masks. First, existing cloud-correction products could be imported from Planet directly. Planet's 'useable data masks' (UDM2) are not available for 2017, only dating back to August 2018 for PlanetScope 4-band imagery. Second, the 'scene-order' can be set when compositing images. Considering the amount of images available for each season, this proved to be an overwhelming task to do manually. Automating this procedure also proved difficult as limited metadata is imported with imagery, despite Planet possessing critical information, like percent-cloud-cover, for each image. If such information were to be availed - linked as metadata for each image - a script could be written to set the scene order by this attribute. Relatedly, PY-ENVI, the integration between ENVI and Python remains poorly documented. Third, cloud masks could be created within ENVI by detecting, then subsequently masking, clouds across images. This procedure is described below. \n",

Further steps to potentiate such analysis are mentioned below in discussion. \n",

    "Two methods for creating a cloud mask were attempted across a subset image - SCENE ID: 20170922_170743_0f2d. This image has substaintial cloud cover, cloud shadow, some haze effects, and overlays where aguadas are monitored. Unfortunately, aguadas are occluded by cloud cover and cloud shadow here. Nonetheless, I use this image to begin creating a cloud mask. \n",

    "First, an example-based classification, relying on a manual selection of cloud and show features, resulted in the below image. Here red denotes 'cloud' while blue denotes 'cloud-shadow'. While the resulting image seems promising, it betrays in two ways: 1) clouds close to one-another 'bleed' into neighbours resulting in an overclassification of cloud; and 2) many major cloud shadows are not detected. For example, a major cloud shadow in the south east portion if the image remains undetected. It may be the case that this cloud and its shadow went undetected due to their being considerable 'haze' in the area. Spectra of haze and cloud differ and would prove difficult without further training. Notably, this example-based classification was not validated beyond visual inspection.\n",

    "Overall, the example based classification may prove to be a worthwhile route for cloud-masking prior to analysis, but would also require more time with training data, validation across different parts of the scene and across both the wet and dry seasons. A (spectral) rule-based classification methodology was also attempted, but yielded considerable noise. \n",

    "\n",
    "Based on data quality issues, I chose to reconsider the spatial scale of this exploratory study. Instead of thinking through solutions for cloud cover, the remainder of this report focuses on a subset of scenes which were cloud-free. These images are of the western region of the CBR and overlaps with three of tweleve monitored aguadas. Like above, these scenes are composited with the ENVI's *Seamless Mosaic* tool. Default parameters for edge-feathering and colour correction were retained as less than 10% of any given image overlapped with others (Pan et al., 2009). Seamlines were not used. This seamless composite, the primary data product for the remainder of the study, is shown below. \n",

    "To aid in intrepreting, a false colour composite is provided above. By altering which bands are read as Blue, Green, and Red, falso colour composites allow users to visualise the Near Infra-Red band. Additionally, 'true' or 'natural' colour composites are difficult to spot subtlities with as they are often 'hazy'. In contrast, the above false colour composite distinguishes otherwise subtle differences by increasing the spectral seperation between bands - thereby increasing the intrepretibility of the mosaic. "
